An efficient and memory-safe Threema Safe server implementation
written in Rust.

This is a private project, not developed nor endorsed by Threema GmbH.

The server spec can be found in the [Cryptography
Whitepaper](https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf).


## Status

Work in progress. The core functionality is implemented, but some additional
things like throttling or expiration still need to be handled. Currently, the
server needs to be manually compiled, but in the future binary builds will be
provided.

- [x] Request config
- [x] Download backups
- [x] Upload backups
- [x] Delete backups
- [x] Settings configurable by user
- [x] User agent validation
- [ ] Throttling
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of expired backups


## Building

Sekurŝranko requires at least Rust 1.31.

To make a release build:

    cargo build --release

You will find the binary at `target/release/sekursranko`.


## Testing

Sekurŝranko is thoroughly covered by unit tests and integration tests.

To run the tests:

    cargo test

In case you want to enable logging:

    RUST_LOG=sekursranko=trace cargo test


## Running

Simply execute the binary with the `-c` or `--config` argument:

    ./sekursranko --config config.toml

You can find an example configfile in this repository at `config.example.toml`.

Configure logging using the `RUST_LOG` env var:

    RUST_LOG=sekursranko=debug ./sekursranko -c config.toml


## Deployment

Sekurŝranko is meant to be run behind a reverse proxy (e.g. Nginx) that does
TLS termination. That's why it currently doesn't support TLS directly.

Note that you cannot backup to a server without TLS from the Threema app.


## Name

The name of this project is the Esperanto word for "safe". English-speaking
people might recognize the "sekur-" prefix (-> secure), and German-speaking
people might recognize the "-ŝranko" suffix (-> "Schrank", a cabinet).
